    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideal job</h2>
    <pre>    best ideal job would be software develperã€‚the benefit are Every day is a new beginning: 
    how to say, very few industries can learn new things every day like programmers. I always talk to my colleagues and 
    say that programming is too interesting. The content of daily work is different from that of the previous day. 
    Every day, I can make new things every day. I have to learn by interest or work. And now new programming languages
    are often invented, new programming techniques are being created, and new technologies give programmers unlimited 
    room for improvement, what drones, IoT, 3D printing, virtual reality, automation, etc. . Countless figures, but also
    look at the present.</Pre>
